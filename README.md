ZEST Enhanced Set Theory Computing Fabric

Abstract

ZEST CF provides processors for the most popular services. to persist, analyze or transfer data.

Processors are abstractions of data services, they are identified and configured by its URL address.

Each processor exposes two channels named In and Out.

In and Out channels expose the same API for different services.

In channel observes the service at its URL and notifies changes.

Operations are written in the Out channel.

Operations and results are expressed in ZEST Enhanced Set Theory notation. ZEST is a JSON notation to describe data, CRUD and Set Theory operations on data.

Processors are thread safe and designed to support parallelism and to scale.

Processors can be piped and coordinated to create a Computing Fabric CF.

ZEST CF to develop the AI algorithms based on the Fractal Graph Meme Theory differing from Neural Networks because producing an explanation in term of graphs to support an hypothesis postulated by [A+M] AI algorithms.
